Skill Swap Platform
A web-based Skill Swap Platform that enables users to offer their skills and request others' skills in return.
This platform fosters peer-to-peer learning by allowing users to connect based on mutual skill needs.

PROBLEM STATEMENT

In a world where individuals possess unique talents and skills, 
there is often a lack of platforms that allow direct skill exchange rather than paid services.

For example:
A designer wants to learn Python.
A Python developer needs a portfolio makeover.
They could swap their skills — but where would they find each other?
Traditional platforms are either:
Focused on job listings (e.g., LinkedIn, Indeed)
Paid marketplaces (e.g., Fiverr, Upwork)
Not peer-to-peer focused
GOAL: Build a platform that allows users to exchange knowledge by offering what they know in return for learning what they don't — via skill swaps.

SOLUTION OVERVIEW
We developed a lightweight, responsive, and intuitive Skill Swap Platform where users can:
Create a public profile with skills they offer and skills they want to learn.
View and search for other users with specific skills.
Initiate swap requests, accept or reject them.
View the status of pending, accepted, and rejected swaps.
This is an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) version focusing on core functionality and frontend experience.
